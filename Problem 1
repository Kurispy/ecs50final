-crossout section-
The optimized code does not have a function prologue and epilogue
The optimized code uses load effective address(leal)

-worker section-
The optimized code does not have a function prologue and eqilogue ***
The optimized code uses square root (line 65).

The optimized code uses floating point compare, line 66 in op code, uses CPU instruction instead of function call in nonop line 63 ***
The addressing modes in the op code are more efficient than the non op code ***
(line 125-126 non op vs line 140 op code)
(line 131-132 non op vs line 144 op code)
   

The non optimized code uses nop (line 73)
The optimized code uses leal on line 83-89, while the nonop code uses addl in line 75-83
